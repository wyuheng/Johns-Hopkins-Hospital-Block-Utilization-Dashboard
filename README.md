# Johns Hopkins Hospital-Block Utilization Dashboard

In a hospital setting, a 'block' refers to a designated timeframe during which a surgeon is granted the right to use an operating room. Currently, in the orthopedics department at Johns Hopkins Hospital, there is an issue with under-reported block utilization rates. This issue has the potential to negatively affect the department's revenue generation.

As part of our consulting team's efforts to address this problem, we proposed several recommendations. One of these recommendations involved creating a real-time utilization dashboard for surgeons. I represented our team in developing a prototype of this dashboard for demonstration purposes.
